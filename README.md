# SQL-Challenge-Projects
The SQL portion of the Data Acquisition module from codecademy

Three optional projects:

#### RPA Fraud Detection
Reputable Product Agency (RPA) has started receiving complaints from their credit card processor about fraudulent transactions. Help your finance department identify potentially risky transactions before they finish processing.

This dataset contains a single table, `transaction_data`.

#### RPA Customer Segmentation
The marketing department of Reputable Product Agency (RPA) is looking to segment the company users by a number of different criteria.

In this context, a segment is a subset of users that meet different conditions. Segments are used to send marketing campaigns to users who meet specific criteria or to measure the performance of specific marketing campaigns.

Use SQL queries to generate user lists for the marketing department. The `users` dataset is imported into the workspace. 

#### Davie's Burgers Subway Ad
The restaurant business has been booming and Davie's Burgers is now looking to place a catchy advertisement in the local subway station.

Help them dig into their `orders` table to see if there is anything interesting in there for a funny tagline!
